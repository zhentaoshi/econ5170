Understanding how to construct an optimization problem and how to implement optimization by oneself is the key step to transform from a consumer of econometrics to a developer of econometrics. Unfortunately,  traditionally econometrics curriculum does not pay enough attention in numerical optimization. The consequence is that many students rely on the procedures that the econometric packages offer.
