    "One cannot acquire a new programming language without investing numerous hours.\n",
    "[R-Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) is an official manual\n",
    "maintained by the R core team.\n",

    "The help system is the first thing we must learn for a new language.\n",
    "In R, if we know the exact name of a function and want to check its usage, we can either call `help(function_name)` or a single question mark `?function_name`.\n",
