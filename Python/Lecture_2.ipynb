    "In this lecture, we will talk about efficient computation in R (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **R is a vector-oriented language. In most cases, vectorization speeds up computation**.\n",
    "*  We turn to more CPUs for parallel execution to save time if there is no more room to optimize the code to improve the speed.\n",
    "*  Clusters are accessed remotely. Communicating with a remote cluster is different from operating a local machine."

    "\n",
    "Despite mathematical equivalence, various ways of calculation can perform distinctively in terms of computational speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does computational speed matter?\n",
    "For a job that takes less than a minutes, the time difference is not a big deal.\n",
    "For modern economic structural estimation problems commonly seen in industrial organization, a single estimation can take up to a week. For those problems code optimization is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other computational intensive procedures include bootstrap, simulated maximum likelihood and simulated method of moments. Even if a single execution does not take much time, repeating such a procedure for thousands of replications will consume a non-trivial duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, optimizing code takes human time. It is a balance of human time and machine time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example__\n",
    "\n",
    "The heteroskedastic-robust variance for the OLS regression is\n",
    "$$(X'X)^{-1} X'\\hat{e}\\hat {e}'X (X'X)^{-1}$$\n",
    "The difficult part is $X'\\hat{e}\\hat {e}'X=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{e}_i^2 x_i x_i'$.\n",
    "There are at least 4 mathematically equivalent ways to compute this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  literally sum over $i=1,\\dots,n$ one by one.\n",
    "2.  $X' \\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{e}^2) X$, with a dense central matrix.\n",
    "3.  $X' \\mathrm{diag}(\\hat{e}^2) X$, with a sparse central matrix.\n",
    "4.  Do cross product to `X*e_hat`. It takes advantage of the element-by-element operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first generate the data of binary response and regressors. Due to the discrete nature of the dependent variable, the error term in the linear probability model is heteroskedastic. It is necessary to use the heteroskedastic-robust variance to consistently estimate the asymptotic variance of the OLS estimator. The code chunk below estimates the coefficients and obtains the residual."
